# Cw-Headstash

<HighlightTag type="concepts"/><HighlightTag type="basics"/>

Welcome to the documentation for The Headstash Contracts. This document will guide you through
understanding the [ICS-27](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/main/spec/app/ics-027-interchain-accounts)
Interchain Accounts protocol, how to use `cw-ica-controller` to create and manage the headstash contracts on
any IBC enabled CosmWasm chain.


The CosmWasm ICA Controller is a CosmWasm contract that implements the ICS-27 interchain accounts controller in
pure Rust. It is designed to be used by other CosmWasm contracts to create and manage interchain accounts on
the chain where the contract is deployed.

The Headstash Contract is also a Cosmwasm contract, that faciliates the registration & authentication of various cryptographic
signatures, for the purpose of  newly minted (or existing) tokens. 

## High Level Overview


### Cw-ICA-Controller 
The following diagram shows how `cw-ica-controller` works at a high level.

![High Level Overview](/img/cw-ica-controller.svg)

The `cw-ica-controller` contract code is deployed on a chain that supports IBC CosmWasm. This chain does not need
to support ICS-27 interchain accounts nor does it need to support any custom IBC bindings. Then when an external
account or a contract instantiates a `cw-ica-controller` contract, the contract will initiate the ICS-27 handshake
with a chain that supports ICS-27 interchain accounts based on the options provided by the caller.

:::note

The counterparty chain need not be a CosmWasm chain. It can be any chain that uses ibc-go and supports `ICS-27`.
Such as CosmosHub, Osmosis, etc.

Then the rest of the ICS-27 handshake is completed by the relayers automatically. Both the hermes relayer and the
go relayer support `ICS-27` interchain accounts. Once the handshake is complete, the `cw-ica-controller` contract
makes a callback to the callback contract if one was provided during instantiation.

### Cw-Headstash 

The following diagram shows how `cw-headstash` is deployed at a high level.

The `cw-ica-owner` & `cw-glob` contracts are also deployed on a chain that supports IBC CosmWasm. These contracts allow this 
chain to deploy the `cw-headstash` and `snip120u` via the ICS-27 handshake.
