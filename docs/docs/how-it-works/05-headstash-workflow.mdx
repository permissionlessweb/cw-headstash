## Headstash LifeCycle

### A. Connect Eligible Wallet

Any Ethereum or Solana address is able to be considered eligible for headstashes. Claimers will choose between the two wallet types to connect, and will automatically generate a prompt specific to if they are eligible.

### B. Generate Throwaway Wallet

If an account is eligible, the next prompts ask the account owner to confirm the throwaway wallet to use to claim their headstash, before verifying their ownership.

### C. Verify Ownership

Once the throwaway wallet is generated and confirmed, a prompt to generate a signature using either Metamask or Phantom wallet occurs.

### D. Register For FeeGrant

Feegrants can be requested only be eligible claimers, and requires providing the signature to an external API, to verify a wallet can request a feegrant. To minimize the chance of leaking the signature to the public, we include ecies encryption via the ecies-wasm package.

### E. Claim Headstash

Now, thats left to do is claim a headstash by broadcasting the msg to claim, with the throwaway wallet, while having this tx covered if the feegrant was needed/registered.

### F. Privately IBC Transfer tokens back to Terp Network
