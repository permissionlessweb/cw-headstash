# `ExecuteMsg`

The `ExecuteMsg` is the message that is used to interact with the `cw-glob` contract.
**All execute messages are only callable by the owner of the contract.**

## `AddGlob`

```rust reference
https://github.com/srdtrk/cw-ica-controller/blob/v0.4.0/src/types/msg.rs#L27-L37
```

This message is used to add a compiled wasm blob with a unique key to reference the wasm blob. It is only callable by one of the owners.



## `HashGlob`

```rust reference
https://github.com/srdtrk/cw-ica-controller/blob/9890793d3a19a9ec068e26627ec99ec48b3b9d92/src/types/msg.rs#L38-L39
```

This message is used to generate the sha256sum of a wasm blob stored inside the contract state. It is only callable by the owner.

## `TakeGlob`

```rust reference
https://github.com/srdtrk/cw-ica-controller/blob/v0.4.0/src/types/msg.rs#L38-L52
```

This will retrieve a stored wasm blob. It is only callable by one of the owners.
